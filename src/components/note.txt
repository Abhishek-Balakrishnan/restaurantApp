Api call in js
--------------
AJAX


-fetch
-xmlhttp
-async await

useeffect use to replace ngonint



redirection in react
--------------------

react-router-dom (npm i react-router-dom)

import { 
    BrowserRouter as Router-all routing need components
    ,Routes                -to set path for each component
    ,Route                 -more than one path
     } from 'react-router-dom';


     useParams - hook used to access params from component url

*REDUX
------

coupling(many connection b/w parrent and child components)

props drilling (if increace coupling)

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent

for this react intraduce new technology  -REDUX


redux process
-------------

create a new js file to keep the states,all the components can access this js file


-the components can access the data from the js file but thay  cant update datas in js file
