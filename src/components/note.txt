Api call in js
--------------
AJAX


-fetch
-xmlhttp
-async await

useeffect use to replace ngonint



redirection in react
--------------------

react-router-dom (npm i react-router-dom)

import { 
    BrowserRouter as Router-all routing need components
    ,Routes                -to set path for each component
    ,Route                 -more than one path
     } from 'react-router-dom';


     useParams - hook used to access params from component url

*REDUX
------

coupling(many connection b/w parrent and child components)

props drilling (if increace coupling)

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent

for this react intraduce new technology  -REDUX


redux process
-------------

create a new js file to keep the states,all the components can access this js file


-the components can access the data from the js file but thay  cant update datas in js file


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:
reducer>                                                                    >data         :
                                                                            +             :--
                                                                            state           |
      ^                                                                                     :
[reaponse as Paylod]                                                                        :
                                                                                            |
                                                                                            :
      ^                                                                                     |
action(logic)                       [Dispatch]                               < component    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:




Action =>a file with all logics to update the state
dispatch=>method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the components need state updation
Reducer=> update the dates in js file according to the Paylod responce get from action file


Libraries to apply redux
------------------------

1-redux
2-REACT REDUX
3-REDUX-THUNK

npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

createStore() - method used to create store in js file
              - 2 args
              -  1-reducer
                 2- middileware(used to make synchronous redux to asynchronous)

applyMiddileware- method in REDUX to apply middileware  

combineReducers()- method in  REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file

thunk - in REDUX-THUNK used to create middileware


1- create store 
2- applay the store in indux .js 
   -provider  -  its a tag used to pass the store (react-redux)
